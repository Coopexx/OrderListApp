# OrderListApp

## Purpose

The process of ordering materials in a big laboratory sometimes gets messy. 
To avoid material shortages and a much cleaner communication about which materials are needed, this application was created.

## How it works

Every employee can access this application over any computer in the local network.
The rest is simple.

Search for the item, you want to order. Specify the amount and ADD the item. 
The project manager gets a list of all items that are needed and can place an order.
Once ordered, the employee can check the status of the order.
